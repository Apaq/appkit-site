# Getting Started

## Preparing for development

Appkit requires a recent LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and npm. Make sure you've installed and/or updated Node before continuing.

> Note that you will need to use npm 6 or higher.

For the sake of simplicity the guides will make use of [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) for setting up projects but as already mentioned you can use Appkit with any library, framework or even with Vanilla JS.

Creating the App will be explained in the <stencil-route-link url="/docs/my-first-app">My First App</stencil-route-link> page and the actual integration of it will be explained in <stencil-route-link url="/docs/integrating-my-app">Integrating My App</stencil-route-link> page.
